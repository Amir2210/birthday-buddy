🎋 Intro:
This project is a simple React component called "BirthdaysList" that displays a list of birthdays. It allows users to see the number of birthdays today, along with the name, age, and image of each person. Additionally, users can clear all birthdays from the list with the "Clear All" button.

📦 Tech Stack:

* JavaScript
* CSS

👩🏽‍🍳 Features:

* Displays the number of birthdays today.
* Lists the name, age, and image of each person.
* Allows users to clear all birthdays from the list.

💭 Process:
I started this project by designing the structure of the BirthdaysList component, including the state management using React's useState hook. Then, I implemented the logic to display the list of birthdays and the functionality to clear all birthdays from the list. Throughout the process, I found it relatively straightforward, although I had to ensure proper handling of state updates. In conclusion, building this component was a valuable learning experience in managing state in React components.

📚 Learnings:

* Learned how to use React's useState hook for managing component state.

* Gained experience in structuring and organizing React components for better readability and maintainability.

✨ Improvement:

* Implementing a feature to add new birthdays dynamically.
* Enhancing the styling and design of the BirthdaysList component.
* Optimizing performance by using memoization techniques for rendering.
